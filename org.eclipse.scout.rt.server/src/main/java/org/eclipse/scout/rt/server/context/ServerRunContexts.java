/**
 * Factory methods to create new {@link ServerRunContext} objects to propagate server-side state and to control
 * {@link TransactionScope}.
 * <p/>
 * A context typically represents a "snapshot" of the current calling state. This class facilitates propagation of that
 * server state among different threads, or allows temporary state changes to be done for the time of executing some
 * code.
 * <p/>
 * A transaction scope controls in which transaction to run executables. By default, a new transaction is started, and
 * committed or rolled back upon completion.
 * <p/>
 * Usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ServerRunContexts.copyCurrent().withLocale(Locale.US).withSubject(...).withSession(...).run(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *   &#064;Override
 *   public void run() throws Exception {
 *      // run code on behalf of the new context
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
