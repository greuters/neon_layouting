=== Transient Dependencies

:doctype: article
:revnumber: {project-version}

As every dependencies build its own dependency tree two dependencies can depend on the same artifact.
But they do not necessarily depend on the same version.
This can result to a classpath with two version of the same dependency.

==== Solution

To work around this problem we define every transient dependency in the dependency management exactly once with a defined version.
To search for all dependencies this script can be used:

    mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.10:resolve | grep '\[INFO\]    ' | cut -d':' -f1-4 | sort | uniq | cut -c11- | grep -v none | grep -v org.eclipse | sed -r 's/(.*):(.*):(.*):(.*)/      \<dependency\>\n        \<groupId\>\1\<\/groupId\>\n        \<artifactId>\2\<\/artifactId\>\n        \<version\>\4\<\/version\>\n      \<\/dependency\>/'

It prints out the dependencies as maven dependencies.
Before this script is used the transient section in the org.eclipse.scout.rt/pom.xml at the end of the dependencyManagement section should be commented or removed.
So we get all dependencies in their intended version.

The output can be pasted to the org.eclipse.scout.rt/pom.xml at the end of the dependencyManagement section.
Then remove duplicates from the transient section.
