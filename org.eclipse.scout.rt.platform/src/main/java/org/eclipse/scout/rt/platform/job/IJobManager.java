/**
 * Job manager to run tasks in parallel.
 * <p>
 * A task is called a job, and consists of some work in the form of a {@link IRunnable} or {@link Callable}, and some
 * instruction information in the form of a {@link JobInput} for the job manager to run the job.
 * <p>
 * This job manager allows to control the maximal number of jobs running concurrently by assigning a job to a
 * {@link IExecutionSemaphore}. That way, jobs which are assigned to the same semaphore run concurrently until they
 * reach the concurrency level as defined for that semaphore. Subsequent tasks then wait in a queue until a permit
 * becomes available. For more information, see {@link JobInput#withExecutionSemaphore(IExecutionSemaphore)}.
 * <p>
 * As a general rule, jobs compete for an execution permit once being fired by the associated trigger, and in the order
 * as being scheduled. For example, if scheduling two jobs in a row, they very likely will have the same execution time
 * (granularity in milliseconds). However, job manager guarantees the first job to compete for an execution permit
 * before the second job does.
 * <p>
 * This job manager supports jobs to be executed some time in the future, or repeatedly based on a schedule. For more
 * information, see {@link JobInput#withExecutionTrigger(ExecutionTrigger)}.

 * @since 5.1
