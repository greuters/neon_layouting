 * Factory methods to create new {@link RunContext} objects to propagate context like the current {@link Subject} and

 * <p>
 * A context typically represents a "snapshot" of the current calling state. This class facilitates propagation of that
 * state among different threads, or allows temporary state changes to be done for the time of executing some code.

 * Usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * RunContexts.copyCurrent().withLocale(Locale.US).withSubject(...).run(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *   &#064;Override
 *   public void run() throws Exception {
 *      // run code on behalf of the new context
 *   }
 * });
